                        <h3>Biography</h3>                    
                        <p>I am currently serving in the US Navy and have been for 8 years. I have been stationed in a few 
                            different states and have traveled quite a bit. My favorite place that I have been to is Philippines, 
                            followed by Japan as a very close second.
                        </p>

                        <h3>My Job</h3>
                        <p>About the job: My job requires me to work on F18E/F engines and engine components. Trouble shooting, removing and 
                            and replacing, schedule and unschedule maintenance are a very busy part of my day. I find it more enjoyable when I 
                            encounter a new problem that I have not faced before. Being able to diagnose an issue and correcting it
                            feels satisfying after seeing an aircraft back in the air. 
                        </p>
