                            <p>We are also sponsored by VETSports. <a href="https://www.vetsports.org/">VETSports</a> is an organization 
                            helps veterans find a community through sports where they feel comfortable seeking help or speaking with other 
                            veterans.

                            <h3>Where we play</h3>
                            <p>The team contributes to paint and maintain the field we play in Corcoran, California. It is just south of Hanford, California on the 43 Highway.
                            We also play in Visalia, California during our away games. Although we do our best to participate during the games, we still have 
                            our jobs to do when it comes to detachments or deployments. 
                            </p>
