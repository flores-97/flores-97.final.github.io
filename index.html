                    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                        <p>The inspiration for creating this team comes from my desire to regain the sense of belonging and 
                        camaraderie that I experienced while serving in the military. Even though I had been living in the 
                        Central Valley, I struggled to connect with the surrounding community and often felt isolated. 
                        To give you a bit of background, I relocated to this area from San Diego in 2019 to work at the 
                        Lemoore Naval Medical Clinic on the Naval Air Station. My wife and I understand the challenges of 
                        being away from family, and how that distance can affect one's sense of community.</p> 
     
                        <p>I began to isolate myself further and fell into a 
                        depression, cutting off the outlet—playing soccer—that had once helped me maintain a healthy 
                        lifestyle. Although my body started to heal, the recovery was slow, and setbacks kept occurring. 
                        I tried various methods to regain my health, but I knew that what I truly needed was to get back to                         playing the sport I loved. That's when the idea came to me: what if I could create a team of veterans 
                        and active duty members who would understand me in a deeper, more intimate way because of the shared 
                        connection of serving our country? This idea began to grow in my mind, and I took a leap of faith. I 
                        told my wife that I wanted to visit the Naval Air Station to see if I could find others who were                         playing soccer and start recruiting. Little did I know that the base regularly holds a Captain's Cup 
                        tournament specifically for soccer. As a veteran, I was allowed to participate as a free agent. I 
                        joined the tournament, and it was a blast—I fit right in. That's when I realized that if I could 
                        convince enough guys to join me, we could create something special. </p>

                        <p>At first, the idea was about reconnecting with the sport for myself, but then God intervened. He connected me with the VETSports
                        organization, and after reading their mission statement, I knew I had to make this a reality. I 
                        prayed and asked God to help me build a team that would serve the mission of combating veteran suicide                         by fostering brotherly companionship and enjoying the sport we love together.
                        That's the heart and soul behind why this team exists.</p>
