                    <h2>22 A DAY</h2>
                            <p>"22 A Day" refers to the alarming statistic that approximately 22 military
                                veterans in the United States take their own lives each day. This figure 
                                highlights a critical mental health crisis among veterans, emphasizing the 
                                urgent need for increased support, resources, and intervention strategies to address 
                                PTSD, depression, and other challenges faced by those who have served in the military. 
                                The campaign often seeks to raise awareness, promote dialogue, and drive efforts to reduce 
                                veteran suicide rates.
                            </p>
